UK English Voice Prompts for Asterisk
=====================================

The included sounds were recorded by Jay Benham for the Asterisk BPX at
his Sound Answers studio. They are free for use with the Asterisk PBX
system, or indeed any other PBX system you can persuade to work with them,
please read the license agreement.


Additional Prompts
------------------

As you customize your Asterisk system, in spite of the wealth of free
material available in this, and other, sound packages you may find you
require additional sound files.

Should you require them, further professionally recorded prompts are
available from Jay.  These will integrate with the existing prompts
included with this file providing a fast and cost effective path for
completing the configuration of your IVR system with a seamless user
experience.
